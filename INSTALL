Waf executable version: 1.7.2

=== How to install ===

3 phases is required:

    $ ./waf configure
    $ ./waf build
    # ./waf install

You can modify the default settings by append arguments to the configure phase.
To see them, execute:

    $ ./waf --help

You can also append your own environment variables (CFLAGS, VALAFLAGS, LDFLAGS, CC)
For instance, if you want to use Clang/LLVM as compiler, configure with:

   $ CC=clang ./waf configure
